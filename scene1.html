        <h2>Annual working hours vs. GDP per capita</h2>
        <div>
            Workers in richer countries tend to work fewer hours than workers in poorer countries.
            This is because in richer countries workers are able to produce more with each hour of work, which
            translates
            into higher incomes and the ability to work less. The large differences in working hours across countries
            have
            important implications for the way we think about the economic progress made in the last two centuries and
            the
            nature of inequality between countries today.
        </div>
        <pre>
        Economic prosperity in different places across our world today is vastly unequal. People in Switzerland, one of
        the richest countries in the world, have an average income that is more than 20-times higher than that of people
        in Cambodia.1 Life in these two countries can look starkly different.2

        When considering such differences in prosperity, a natural question is: who works more, people in richer
        countries like Switzerland or in poorer ones like Cambodia?

        Looking at the available data, the answer is clear: workers in poorer countries actually tend to work more, and
        sometimes much more.

        We see that in the chart here, with GDP per capita on the horizontal axis and annual working hours per worker on
        the vertical axis.

        Countries like Cambodia (which is the country in the very top-left corner) or Myanmar have some of the lowest
        GDP per capita but highest working hours. In Cambodia the average worker puts in 2,456 hours each year, nearly
        900 more hours than in Switzerland (1,590 hours) at the bottom-right of the chart. The extra 900 hours for
        Cambodian workers means longer work days and many fewer days off.
