        Workers in richer countries tend to work fewer hours than workers in poorer countries.
        This is because in richer countries workers are able to produce more with each hour of work, which translates
        into higher incomes and the ability to work less. The large differences in working hours across countries have
        important implications for the way we think about the economic progress made in the last two centuries and the
        nature of inequality between countries today.
