        <h2>At the heart of the link between productivity, incomes, and working hours is technological innovation</h2>
        <div>
            Technological innovation — defined broadly here to include physical machines as well as ideas, knowledge,
            and
            processes — makes it possible for each worker to become much more productive. And increases in productivity
            in
            turn help drive both increases in incomes and decreases in working hours.

            A prime example of how tech innovation drives productivity growth is agriculture. As we show in detail in
            our
            entry on Crop Yields, innovations like better machinery, crop varieties, fertilizers, and land management
            have
            enabled farmers to be much more productive. In the US, for example, farm production per labor hour increased
            nearly 16-fold from 1948–2011. This increased productivity enables us to feed a rapidly growing population,
            even while the fraction of people working in agriculture is smaller than ever.

            The chart here shows the growth in labor productivity, not just for agriculture but for the entire economy.
            The
            technological, economic, and social structures in richer countries have enabled workers there to produce
            more
            while working less.

            Besides tech innovation, there is evidence that working fewer hours can itself keep productivity higher,
            making
            the link between working hours and productivity self-reinforcing. For example, economist John Pencavel
            (2015)
            studied munitions workers in war-time Britain and found that their productivity stayed high up to a certain
            threshold of hours, but declined markedly above that threshold. We’ve probably all experienced the drop in
            productivity that comes at the end of a very long day of work.
