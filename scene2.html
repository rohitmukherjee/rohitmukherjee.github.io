        <h2>People are able to work less when they work in more productive economies</h2>
        <div>The key driver of rising national incomes and decreasing working hours is productivity growth.

            Productivity refers to the rate at which inputs are turned into outputs. To understand working hours the key
            metric is labor productivity: the economic return for one hour of work.

            At the most concrete level, labor productivity captures things like the number of breads that a baker bakes
            in an hour, or the number of cars factory workers assemble in an hour. At the most comprehensive level, it
            relates the total output of the economy (GDP) to the total labor input (total annual hours worked), giving
            us the aggregate measure of labor productivity, GDP per hour of work.

            Higher labor productivity is associated with fewer working hours, as shown in the chart here with labor
            productivity on the horizontal axis and annual working hours on the vertical axis. The chart currently shows
            data for the latest available year, but you can explore this relationship over time since 1950 by using the
            blue time slider at the bottom of the chart.

            We see that the same richer countries with lower working hours we noted before — like Germany and
            Switzerland — have very high labor productivity, both at nearly 70$
            per hour. If workers can produce more with each hour of work, it becomes possible for them to work less.

            Though this doesn’t necessarily mean they actually do work less — workers in the US and Singapore, for
            instance,
            work many more hours than their counterparts in countries with similar productivity.4

            In contrast, the countries toward the top-left of this chart have far lower labor productivity — Cambodia,
            for example, is at only 2$ per hour — and thus workers there need to work many more hours to compensate.
