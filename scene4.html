    <h2>What we learn from this</h2>
    <div>
        The data show that it is workers in poorer countries who tend to work more, and sometimes a lot more, than those
        in richer countries.

        This has large implications for the way we think about the economic progress made in the last two centuries and
        the nature of inequality between countries today.

        It means that residents of today’s poorer countries like Cambodia and Myanmar — and also of today’s richer
        countries in the past when they were poor — are not just consumption poor, often unable to afford necessities
        like food and medicine. It means they are also leisure poor: because productivity is low and they must work so
        much just to scrape by, they can’t afford to spend much time improving their condition, becoming educated, or
        simply enjoying leisure time.

        That people in poorer countries work so much more than in richer countries shows that differences in prosperity
        are not due to differences in work ethic — they are largely due to differences in circumstance and opportunity.
