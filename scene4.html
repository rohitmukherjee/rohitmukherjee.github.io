        <h2>What we learn from this</h2>
        <div>
            The data show that it is workers in poorer countries who tend to work more, and sometimes a lot more, than
            those
            in richer countries.

            This has large implications for the way we think about the economic progress made in the last two centuries
            and
            the nature of inequality between countries today.

            It means that residents of today’s poorer countries like Cambodia and Myanmar — and also of today’s richer
            countries in the past when they were poor — are not just consumption poor, often unable to afford
            necessities
            like food and medicine. It means they are also leisure poor: because productivity is low and they must work
            so
            much just to scrape by, they can’t afford to spend much time improving their condition, becoming educated,
            or
            simply enjoying leisure time.

            That people in poorer countries work so much more than in richer countries shows that differences in
            prosperity
            are not due to differences in work ethic — they are largely due to differences in circumstance and
            opportunity.
