I've written several blog posts about managing time, health, general well being and happiness. This post deals more with growth strategies and how to prevent the mind itself from leading you down dark corridors.

1. Go big or go home  - Work hard, adhere to a set of ideals (that are a tad unrealistic) and then revel in the bitter disappointment of failure knowing that you tried your best or the ecstatic joy of a dream come true. Side - effects of this are rudimentary stages of sociopathic behaviour, mini - sagas playing out in your head, a skewed sense of reality and self  - worth and the blunt knife of melancholy that brings about slow death if you take any of your ventures too seriously and things don't work out.

2. Managed Expectations - Aim for consistent growth (a few percent a year) in a metric you hold dear to your heart and then feel happiness in the absolute growth figures. Don't pay too much thought to the dizzying highs and the nadirs of the year. Consistent growth is what matters. Keep looking back to see how far you've come (instant pick me up).

3. Never have too much of your head in the game - This has been the panacea for me in most aspects but I find this ridiculously hard to follow. Humans of all shapes, sizes and colours have one thing in common - regardless of their work ethic and surroundings - an aspirational mindset.

The aspirational mindset ensures we keep challenging the status quo, pushing forward and leveraging the opportunities presented to us at any instant of time. This is probably what years of Calvinism, institutional pedagogy and parents have drilled in through various means of social engineering and subliminal messaging. The aspirational mindset is what makes you long for the yacht, the frequent flyer miles and the six figure salary.

## An Honest Confession

The three growth strategies I've outlined have their own strengths and weakness. I'll spare you the SWOT analysis and instead talk about how I've used any/a combination of them and the results.

* Going big or going home - This is about when you aspire for something the heart intensely desires and craves. The longing is so visceral that your brain confabulates scenarios entailing entitlement and a perfect life. This hasn't happened to me very many times. I pride myself on being (reasonably) level headed so I don't glorify most opportunities that present themselves.

However, there is the odd case when I feel the visceral longing and unfortunately, things have never worked out for me when I've held things in such high regard. I've also borne the brunt of the side effects such as melancholy and cognitive dissonance.

* Managed Expectations - Never been able to implement this successfully, My brain and internal models of growth reject the very notion of a predictable growth curve and that's why my expectations also grow unpredictably, it's not possible for me to fit my growth/expectations to a particular curve because the curve itself changes.

Never have too much of your head in the game - This has worked for me quite reliably - studying in Singapore, studying in Zurich, job interviews and even interpersonal relations. Sometimes, a healthy distance and absence of obsession yields the best results.

Of course, there is some serendipity involved. I find this model extremely hard to follow because the aspirational mind rejects this. This mostly happens when I'm physically or mentally exhausted and feel on a visceral level that the pursuit doesn't matter.
